# Chat-socket

A chat project using sockets involves building a real-time messaging system where multiple users can communicate over a network. The core of the system is based on socket programming, typically using TCP/IP for reliable data transmission. A server socket listens for incoming client connections, while each client establishes a socket connection to the server. Once connected, users can send and receive text messages, which the server broadcasts to all active clients, enabling group chat functionality. This project demonstrates key networking concepts such as concurrency, data serialization, and asynchronous communication, and is often implemented using programming languages like Python, Java, or C++. It serves as a foundational exercise in network programming and is highly relevant for understanding client-server architecture.
